1. Is the difficulty of the enemies too little?
2. Are the puzzle/switch mazes too easy? Should I add more complex challenges for the player?
3. Does the layout feel progressive enough for the audience to understand?
   Would it be better if there were clear markings for the player to follow?
4. Were the switches too hard to find, or were they in good places for the player to follow?
5. Were the controls easy enough to navigate? Did the player move well enough within the game for the controls to make sense?
